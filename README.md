## About

> Our final project is going to combine everything you’ve learned so far: you’re going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

In this **The Odin Project** assignment we are tasked with building a web-based, functioning calculator. This calculator is capable of multiple operations, while also being able to store a running total for chaining operations. HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript were used in the project.
