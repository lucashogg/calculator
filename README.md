## About

> Our final project is going to combine everything you’ve learned so far: you’re going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

In this **The Odin Project** assignment we are tasked with building a web-based, functioning calculator.

### Features

-   Basic math operations (+), (-), (\*), (/)
-   Ability to use decimal
-   Ability to delete typos

### Technologies

-   Javascript
-   CSS
-   HTML

### What I Learned

This was one took a little bit to wrap my head around. The main thing was figuring out the logic when a user doesn't perform an operation in order, eg. pressing buttons in this order: "1 + 1 =", but instead decides to use another operator before "=" or deletes a number mid-calculation. A lot of conditional statements had to be taken into consideration, which I never actually sat around and thought about in regards to a calculator before. Once I was able to talk through each scenario, the code came next.
